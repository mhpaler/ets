# Specialized workflow for Solidity smart contract validation
#
# Process flow:
# 1. Detects changes in packages/contracts/contracts/**
# 2. When contract changes are found:
#    - Restores cached workspace from parent workflow
#    - Runs Solhint for static analysis
#    - Executes contract test suite
#
# Environment setup:
# - Uses test mnemonic for local testing
# - Disables Ethernal for CI environment
