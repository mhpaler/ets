# Primary orchestrator workflow for pull request validation and testing
#
# Key responsibilities:
# 1. Validates branch rules:
#    - Changes to apps/* must target stage branch
#    - Changes to packages/* must target main branch
# 2. Sets up the development environment:
#    - Installs Node.js and PNPM
#    - Caches the workspace for downstream workflows
# 3. Triggers verify.yml for code quality checks
# 4. Analyzes size impact for package changes targeting main
#
# The workspace cache (keyed by github.sha) is consumed by:
# - verify.yml
# - solidity-screener.yml
